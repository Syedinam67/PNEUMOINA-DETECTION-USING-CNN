# PNEUMOINA-DETECTION-USING-CNN
## Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based system designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. By leveraging the power of ResNet18 architecture, the model classifies X-ray images as either Normal or Pneumonia with high accuracy. The system is built to aid healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses quickly and effectively.
## Key Features
Deep Learning-Powered: Utilizes ResNet18, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture.
Binary Classification: Classifies X-ray images into two categories: Normal and Pneumonia.
User-Friendly Interface: Drag-and-drop functionality with an additional "Choose File" option for uploading images.
Performance Metrics: Includes confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve for detailed performance evaluation.
Real-Time Predictions: Provides instant predictions with confidence scores for uploaded X-ray image

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Robo flow:(https://universe.roboflow.com/mohamed-traore-2ekkp/chest-x-rays-qjmia/dataset/4)
**It contains**:
